# TicTacToe-Game-

There are a lot of TicTacToe games in the IT-world. I also created one of them. But this is unique one now I will explain why:

My project meets almost all requirements which were given by teacher. These are: work with files, unit tests, work with classes and ext.

I can say that this is uniq game, because you can play with computer and computer can also play by itself.

First, when project opens you will choose the way of a game.

So, let's start!
